You've forked a repo, now what?

![](../images/resync1.png)

## Syncing your fork

You can sync your fork with the.. "Sync fork" button.

![](../images/resync2.png)

Click "Update branch".

## Update branch

Click "Update branch".

After syncing:

```
This branch is 2 commits ahead of, 3 commits behind tdscience/course:main.
```

How to do this with the `gh cli`: use `gh repo sync`.

Example usage from this morning showing how to deal with merge conflicts:

```
robin@robin-Apollo:~/github/robinlovelace$ gh repo clone course
fatal: destination path 'course' already exists and is not an empty directory.
failed to run git: exit status 128
robin@robin-Apollo:~/github/robinlovelace$ cd course/
robin@robin-Apollo:~/github/robinlovelace/course$ git log -n 2

can't sync because there are diverging changes; use `--force` to overwrite the destination branch

hint: You have divergent branches and need to specify how to reconcile them.
hint: You can do so by running one of the following commands sometime before
hint: your next pull:
hint:
hint:   git config pull.rebase false  # merge
hint:   git config pull.rebase true   # rebase
hint:   git config pull.ff only       # fast-forward only
hint:
hint: You can replace "git config" with "git config --global" to set a default
hint: preference for all repositories. You can also pass --rebase, --no-rebase,
hint: or --ff-only on the command line to override the configured default per
hint: invocation.
fatal: Need to specify how to reconcile divergent branches.
robin@robin-Apollo:~/github/robinlovelace/course$ git config pull.rebase false

## Topic selection

Mind-mapping tools including pen and paper and online tools such as [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/).

An advantage with Excalidraw is that you can instantly share your mindmap and collaborate with others.

See <https://excalidraw.com/#room=cf5501f9193c8345ee2d,h6D4Ddxni6JBK0dg0m2aZQ> for an example mindmap.

# Exercises

## Generate a 'mind map' of a topic of interest to you

-   Go to [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) and start sketching an idea, including inputs and outputs
-   Bonus: discuss with a partner and get feedback

## Create a reproducible paper skeleton

Create a file called `paper.qmd` in your project folder, and add the following content:

``` yaml
---
title: "Your title here"
author: "Your name here"
format: html
---
```

Add headings with the following structure:

``` markdown
# Introduction {#sec-intro}

<!-- TODO: add content -->

# Methods {#sec-methods}

# Results {#sec-results}

# Discussion {#sec-discussion}

# References
```

## Add your mindmap to the paper as Figure 1

-   Export your mindmap from excalidraw as a PNG or JPG file or take a screenshot
-   Save the image in a folder called `images` in your project folder, or paste it into the paper while in visual mode
-   Add it to your paper under the Introduction section, with a caption

## Any questions before we move to the practical session?
