## Recap of Day 1

# Topic selection

Mind-mapping tools including pen and paper and online tools such as [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/).

An advantage with Excalidraw is that you can instantly share your mindmap and collaborate with others.

See <https://excalidraw.com/#room=cf5501f9193c8345ee2d,h6D4Ddxni6JBK0dg0m2aZQ> for an example mindmap.

# Exercises

## Generate a 'mind map' of a topic of interest to you

-   Go to [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) and start sketching an idea, including inputs and outputs
-   Bonus: discuss with a partner and get feedback

## Create a reproducible paper skeleton

Create a file called `paper.qmd` in your project folder, and add the following content:

``` yaml
---
title: "Your title here"
author: "Your name here"
format: html
---
```

Add headings with the following structure:

``` markdown
# Introduction {#sec-intro}

<!-- TODO: add content -->

# Methods {#sec-methods}

# Results {#sec-results}

# Discussion {#sec-discussion}

# References
```

## Add your mindmap to the paper as Figure 1

-   Export your mindmap from excalidraw as a PNG or JPG file or take a screenshot
-   Save the image in a folder called `images` in your project folder, or paste it into the paper while in visual mode
-   Add it to your paper under the Introduction section, with a caption

## Any questions before we move to the practical session?
