# Rename your repo

Search the official GitHub documentation at docs.github.com for "rename a repository".

It should take you [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/renaming-a-repository).

Follow the instructions to rename your repo to `eitcourse-yourname`.

You can also rename it using the `gh cli` with:

``` bash
gh repo rename eitcourse-robinlovelace
```

It will ask you to confirm.
Type "y" if you're sure.
