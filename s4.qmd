## Cross-references

Cross-referencing allows you to refer to sections, figures, tables, and code blocks within your document. This is essential for academic writing. To cross-reference content in your document, you need to give it a label first, which will be used for referencing.

## Sections

For sections, you can label a particular section using the `{#sec-yourlabel}` syntax. For example, in this `h2` heading for the results section:

```
## Results {#sec-results}
```

Then, to reference it elsewhere in your text, use `@sec-yourlabel`, like this:

```
As shown in @sec-results, ...
```

### Tables and figures

Tables and figures are among the most common elements for presenting data and results. For them, you will use `tbl-` and `fig-` instead of `sec-`.

There are two main methods to cross-reference them. If the table or figure is generated by a code chunk, you can use the `label:` option in your chunk to identify them. For example, the table produced by the code below will be referenced with `@tbl-planets`.

```{{python}}
#| label: tbl-planets
#| tbl-cap: Astronomical object

from IPython.display import Markdown
from tabulate import tabulate
table = [["Sun","696,000",1.989e30],
         ["Earth","6,371",5.972e24],
         ["Moon","1,737",7.34e22],
         ["Mars","3,390",6.39e23]]
Markdown(tabulate(
  table, 
  headers=["Astronomical object","R (km)", "mass (kg)"]
))
```

The other case is when tables and figures are created directly using Markdown. You will have to include a similar tag as for the sections, in this case `{#tbl-mylabel}`. Then, in your text you can use the same method to reference them: `@tbl-letters`.

```
| Name  | Value |
|-------|-------|
| A     | 10    |
| B     | 20    |

: Caption {#tbl-letters}
```

Or in the case of a figure:

```
![An Elephant](elephant.png){#fig-elephant}
```

::: callout-tip
To add captions to your code-generated tables and figures, use `fig-cap` or `tbl-cap` in the chunk headers.

## Citations

Citations to reference external sources such as journal articles, books, or websites can also be used in Quarto. They can be added manually, but we recommend integrating [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) into your workflow. This integration is already set up in RStudio and Positron in the visual editor. For VS Code, you can install an extension to use citations from your Zotero library, e.g. [Citation Picker for Zotero](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mblode.zotero).

It is also important to have a tidy set of citation keys for your references, since you will use those to reference them in your text. The [Better BibTeX plug-in](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/) can help with that.

Once you have Zotero and your IDE integrated, the process should be smooth following these steps:

- Add a bibliography file (e.g., `references.bib`) to your project.

- In your YAML header, include:

    ```
    bibliography: references.bib
    ```

- To cite a source, use `[@key]` in your text:

    ```
    Recent studies show... [@smith2020].
    ```

## Bibliographies

By default, bibliographies list all cited sources at the end of your document. The bibliography will be rendered automatically based on your citations.

If you want to include it in a different place in your document (not at the end), you can include `::: {#refs} :::` in the location where you want to render the list of references.

One last important element is the format of the references and citations. Different institutions require different styles; you can easily change the style of referencing by including a CSL (Citation Style Language) file to configure Quarto to render citations and references with that particular style. You should include a line similar to this in your YAML file:

```
csl: mycsl.csl
```

## Practical: adding citations and references to your paper

Try the following steps:

- Add a bibliography file to your project.
- Cite at least one source in your document.
- Create a figure and a table, each with a label and caption.
- Reference your figure and table in the text using cross-references.
- Render your document and check that citations, references, and cross-references are formatted correctly.
- Bonus: Find someone else's `eitcourse` repo and clone it. Can you reproduce the results?
  - You could ask you neighbour to share their repository with you.
  - Or try `robinlovelace/eitcourse` or `juanfonsecals1/eitcourse`.
